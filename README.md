# almost_daily_code
Let's do this. (Nearly) daily code practice using challenges and puzzles from Project Euler, r/dailyprogrammer, Code Wars, or learnhowtoprogram.com. Ruby and Python.

##Details
This repo has a bunch of code chunks from practice kata. Moving forward, most kata will have specs/test written as I'm moving toward adding TDD (Test-Driven Development) to my software development toolbox.
